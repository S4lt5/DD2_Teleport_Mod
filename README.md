# DD2_Teleport_Mod
Dragons Dogma 2 Teleport Mod, Liberally Cloned from NSACloud's Teleport Mod for RE.

I was stuck, badly, and had no way out.

Install https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma2/mods/8 

Drop this in your Dragons Dogma 2 / reframework/ directory.

In the mod menu, scroll down to "Script UI" and turn on noclip. Don't move too fast down or you will take falling damage and die!

It's a bit janky because apparently as you walk around it loads different areas, so there are other mechanisms at play.
